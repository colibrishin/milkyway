## TLDR
 - A abstract concept of some blockchain network stores various pretrained deep learning model weights
 - Compete conflicts by Cross-validation loss and metrics. (i.e, IoU, Recall, F1, Accuracy..)
 - Federation training-ish. Distribute a dataset to initial peers and improve weights.
 - Expect to use pretrained weights from networks for Transfer Learning.
